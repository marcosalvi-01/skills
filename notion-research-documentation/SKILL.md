# Notion Research Documentation

Synthesize many Notion sources into one decision-useful document.

## Quick Start

1. Define scope, audience, and desired output format.
2. Search and fetch high-relevance Notion sources.
3. Extract evidence, dates, and conflicting claims.
4. Write the output in the right format (brief, summary, comparison, full report).
5. Add inline citations and a references section.

## Workflow

### 1) Gather sources

- Start broad, then narrow with refined queries.
- Prefer recent and authoritative pages for critical claims.

### 2) Choose output format

- Quick brief for fast readouts.
- Research summary for single-topic synthesis.
- Comparison for options and trade-offs.
- Comprehensive report for executive or deep technical decisions.

### 3) Synthesize findings

- Group evidence by themes/questions.
- Flag unknowns, contradictions, and stale data.
- Separate observations from recommendations.

### 4) Publish in Notion

- Create or update a destination page.
- Include title, summary, key findings, evidence, and next steps.
- Keep citations precise enough to verify quickly.

### 5) Final pass

- Check factual consistency and citation completeness.
- Add open questions and suggested follow-up tasks when needed.

## References

- Use format guidance and templates in `reference/`.
- Use `reference/citations.md` for citation style.
- Use `examples/` for report shape and depth.
