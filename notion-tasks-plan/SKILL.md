# Notion Tasks Plan

Use this as a lightweight planning layer.

## Workflow

1. Fetch source page and linked references.
2. Extract requirements, constraints, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
3. Propose phased implementation plan.
4. Write a plan page in Notion linked to the source.
5. Optionally create task items from each implementation step.

## Plan Shape

- Overview and scope.
- Technical approach.
- Phases/milestones with checklists.
- Risks, dependencies, and verification criteria.
